**Description:**

This repository contains code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using the `cats_vs_dogs` dataset from TensorFlow Datasets. The primary objective is to demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN for binary image classification tasks.

## Overview:

In this project, we use a CNN architecture to classify images as either cats or dogs. The dataset is preprocessed, and a CNN model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained and evaluated on a split of training and validation data. We visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss to assess the model's performance.

### Key Steps:

1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the `cats_vs_dogs` dataset from TensorFlow Datasets. Preprocess the images by resizing and normalizing them.

2. **CNN Architecture Design:** Design a CNN architecture comprising convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

3. **Model Compilation and Training:** Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. Train the model on the training dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation dataset by analyzing accuracy and loss metrics.

5. **Prediction and Visualization:** Perform predictions on sample images from the dataset and visualize the model's predictions along with the actual labels.


By exploring this repository, users can learn how to build and train CNN models for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. Feel free to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques to improve the model's performance.
